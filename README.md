# Inhabitent- Project 4

#Summary 

In this project I use a custom wordpress theme that required useing PHP, JQuery, and CSS/SASS.

# The language that use in this project: 

* JavaScript
* JQuery
* CSS/SASS
* Gulp
* WordPress CMS
* WordPress Underscore (theme basis)
* Git/Github


# What I've learn from this Project :

Working with Red Starter theme involved a lot of styling and that was both a fun and challenging experience, especially since it's a multi-page site unlike our other projects that I've done in class.
